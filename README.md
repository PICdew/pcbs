# Naan BB like pcbs

Simple layouts for breadboard like pcb's I use.  They are cheap to have made from most of the modern off-shore PCB houses. 
Usually, 13$USD for or so for 10 boards shipped, <b>cheaper if it's your first time ordering</b>. This is much cheaper than many of the pre-made BB like PCB's offered by others and the quality will be much better. You could do first time orders from several houses and get a lot for less money ;)

The XLRG Naan will run about 13$USD shipped for 5 boards.  It's almost 10cm x 2 in size. 

Note: Some PCB makers have the size cap at 50mm before the price goes up per board. JLCPCB and PCBWay are 100mm before the per board increase. Always check as you enter the board info on the sellers site.

Just upload the zip file to the PCB makers site of your choice.

See the png files for what the boards look like. Note that the half-naan's lettering is wrong and has been fixed in the gerbers included in the zip file.
