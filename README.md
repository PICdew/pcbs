# Naan BB like pcbs

Simple layouts for breadboard like pcb's I use.  They are cheap to have made from most of the modern off-shore PCB houses. 
Usually, 13$USD for or so for 10 boards shipped. This is much cheaper than many of the pre-made BB like PCB's offered by others.

Just upload the zip file to the PCB maker of your choice.
