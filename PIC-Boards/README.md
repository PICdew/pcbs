#Pic proto boards

Proto typing boards for the PIC12F and one of the PIC12F/16F chips. The Pic12/16 should work with any PIC that has the same programming and power pin placment as the 12F chips. I will make a list of know chips as time permits.  Each board has room for a voltage regulator with in put and output caps, a test LED with resistor, 2 terminal screw terminal, pin headers and a small proto area.<br>
