<b>Pic proto boards</b>

Proto typing boards for the PIC12F and one of the PIC12F/16F chips. The Pic12/16 should work with any PIC that has the same programming and power pin placment as the 12F chips. I will make a list of known chips as time permits.  Each board has room for a voltage regulator (7505 or the like) with input and output caps, a test LED with resistor, 2-terminal screw terminal, programing header, chip pin headers and a small prototyping area.<br><br>

<b>Getting PCBs manufactured:</b>

Just download the zip file from this site for the PCB you want and upload the that file to the PCB makers site of your choice and enter the size info if needed included below for the board you want to have manufactured.<br><br>

Pic12F board size: H:34mm X W:39mm<br>
Pic12/16F board size: H:49mm X W:39mm<br><br>
